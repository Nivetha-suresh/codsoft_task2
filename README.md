my task is to develop a machine learning model about iris flower classification.
PROCESS:
      1.Load the Dataset: Use Python libraries like pandas or scikit-learn to load the Iris flower dataset.
      2.Data Exploration: Analyze the data by visualizing feature distributions and checking for correlations between features.
      3.Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set evaluates its performance on unseen data.
      4.Model Training: Choose a suitable algorithm and train the model on the training data. Hyperparameter tuning might be required to optimize the model's performance.
      5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing set using metrics like classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
      6.Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the species of new Iris flowers based on their features
